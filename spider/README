===============DATABASE SCHEMA==========================
schedule-> train stoppage station code,train number,train departure time

stncode-> maps station code to station name

stnlist-> databse similar to stncode but with column for latitude and longitude.

train-> maps train number to train name

========================================================



===================HOW TO USE============================
1) Run spider.py
2) Run geolocator.py until all stations have their latitudes and longitudes mapped out. As Google maps allows limited request each 24 hours, you have to run it as
many times until all stations have been mapped out.
4) Three databases: schedule,stnlist,train will contain everything you need.
